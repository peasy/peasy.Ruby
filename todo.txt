#documentation for github

#review ruby projects on github for
  - organizational structure
  - file references

#create mappings concept - list fields for entities and the fields that can/cannot be updated - equivalent of .net attributes

#write tests for the framework

#introduce different types of errors so that the consumer can respond differently (ValidationError, BusinessRuleError, AuthorizationError) -> consumer can check the type and issue statuses accordingly (400s)

Pros

~ enforces developer consistency
~ facilitates scalability via injectable data proxies
~ reduces dependencies on other frameworks, such as rails and active record
~ facilitates highly reusable code
~ faciliates easy to write tests
~ easy to extend
~ keep validation, business, and authorization rules in one place
